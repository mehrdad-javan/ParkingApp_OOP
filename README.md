# Parking Rental App

## Scenario
> Imagine you're tasked with creating a parking rental application to streamline parking management.    
> In this system, customers reserve parking spots, each with unique details like their name and phone number etc.  
> These reservations are linked to specific parking spaces, which can either be occupied or vacant.  
> Customers have the option to associate a vehicle with their reservation by providing its license plate and type,  
> such as car or motorcycle etc. The parking lot, identified by an area code, consists of multiple parking spaces.  
> This application facilitates efficient organization and management of parking reservations, ensuring a seamless  
> experience for both customers and parking operators.

## Domain Model vs Class Diagram
### Domain Model
- Focus: It focuses on the entities (objects or concepts) with their attributes and relationships.
- Details: It provides an abstraction of the domain, describing the key concepts, their properties, and how they relate to each other.
- Purpose: It helps in understanding the problem domain, defining the scope of the software system, and guiding the software design process by providing a common understanding of the domain.

### Class Diagram
- Focus: It mainly focuses on the classes, their attributes, methods, and the relationships between classes.
- Details: It provides details about the structure of the software system, including classes, interfaces, associations, inheritance, and dependencies.
- Purpose: It helps in visualizing the structure of the system, understanding the relationships between classes, and designing the software architecture.
